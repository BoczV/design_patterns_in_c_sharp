# Design patterns project overview

## Concept of design patterns
Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. 
Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development. 
These solutions were obtained by trial and error by numerous software developers over quite a substantial period of time.

## Gang of four
In 1994, four authors Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides published a book titled 
Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software which initiated the concept of Design Pattern in Software development.
These authors are collectively known as Gang of Four (GOF). According to these authors design patterns are primarily based on the following principles 
of object orientated design:
  - Program to an interface not an implementation
  - Favor object composition over inheritance

## Usage of Design Pattern
Design Patterns have two main usages in software development.

### Common platform for developers
Design patterns provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenario. For example, a singleton design pattern signifies use of 
single object so all developers familiar with single design pattern will make use of single object and they can tell each other that program is following 
a singleton pattern.

### Best Practices
Design patterns have been evolved over a long period of time and they provide best solutions to certain problems faced during software development. 
Learning these patterns helps unexperienced developers to learn software design in an easy and faster way.

## Types of Design Patterns
As per the design pattern reference book Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software , there are 23 design patterns which can be 
classified in three categories: Creational, Structural and Behavioral patterns. We'll also discuss another category of design pattern: J2EE design patterns.
